# Instructions

If your project requires some installation or similar, please inform your user 'bout it. For instance, if you want a more decent indentation of your .php files, you could edit [.editorconfig]('/.editorconfig').

# Code review

1. Consider the number of files. It is often good to split up code in several files to make it more readable, but if a large number of files are not put in a proper folder structure they can be quite hard to follow. Are everything in use, or are som testing files still there?
2. The index.php has got "print_r(fetchRoomNameCost($database)[1]["price"])" right at he top. This is probably just for testing, so there is no need to keep it in the finished code.
3. There is "include __DIR__ . "/hotelFunctions.php";" and "include __DIR__ . "/form.php";" at the top of index.php. They should probably be exchanged by "Require" when the finished webpage is deployed, since we don't want the code to proceed if something goes wrong with that piece of critical code on a finished webpage.
